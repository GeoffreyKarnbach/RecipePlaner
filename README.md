# Recipe Planer

RecipePlaner: Your all-in-one digital cookbook and smart grocery planner for seamless meal preparation and shopping!

## Concept

Everyone knows that feeling, you have a few tomatoes, peppers, some cucumber left in the fridge. What meal could you prepare with those ingredients to avoid them going to waste.

Of course! A greek salad would be a perfect fit, but what else do I need, and how can I come up with those receipes if my ingredients are more exotic?

Let me introduce Recipe Planer, a digital cookbook and inventory management software, to keep track of the groceries you have at home and will need at home in order to cook your favourite receipes!

## Features

Amongst many feature we support:

- Creation of new ingredients (name, category, image, measure unit) / Edit
- Filtering of ingredients (according to custom criterias) and ability to have a detail view for each ingredient
- Creation of new recipes (name, description, preparation time, category, custom images)
- Ability to add recipe steps, ingredients, reviews to a recipe
- Filtering of recipes to find the perfect recipe (filtering by classical filters, by difficulty, by ingredients contained in the recipe)
- Detailed View of a Recipe and ability to plan a recipe in the integrated calendar
- See calendar of all planed meals

## Possible expansions

Some further features have not been implemented yet but are in planing (see the GitHub Issues):
- Plan a grocery store trip in the store
- Recipe recommendation based on available ingredients
- Automatically generate a grocery list based on the planed recipes

Further features could be added later on (but are not planed yet), for instance:
- Price comparaison of ingredient prices in most popular supermarkets (BILLA, SPAR, HOFER...)
- Integration of the webapplication with voice assistants (such as Amazon Alexa) to interact by voice with the program
- Programmatically prefill the recipe list and ingredient list by fetching data from the internet
- Recipe recommendation on a start page
- Estimate the amount of calories in each recipe
- Ability to export the calendar with planed recipes and grocery store trips to ICAL.
